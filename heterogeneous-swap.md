# Heterogeneous swap

A colleague of mine asked me a question about the most effective way to transform a `string` into a `vector<int8_t>`, a sequence of [ASCII codes](http://www.asciitable.com/), where each one character in the input `string` gets its integer ASCII code assigned.

That can be easily [solved with a `std::transform`](https://gist.github.com/insooth/30fa720d0d18eafc733880bef3d01acc) and an explicit cast. It can be solved even easier by simply picking the proper types at software design phase (which is an obvious rule, but not commonly enforced).

In fact, we do a cast to make compiler happy rather than to change the underlying binary representation. Since `string::value_type` and `int8_t` are identical in memory (both occupy a byte), and both `vector` and `string` are (roughly) _equivalent_ to `T*` and some metadata (if small buffer/string optimisation, SBO/SSO, is not considered, or we allocate enough memory to bypass it), we may be tempted to do a swap:

```
string s = "Hello world";

vector<int8_t> v;
assert(v.empty());

swap(s, v);  // <<<

assert(s.empty());
```

It would be great if the above worked well, but it didn't. STL's [`swap` is defined](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/swap) for homogeneous types (here: `T` type), i.e. (simplified)

```c++
template<class T> void swap(T&, T&);
//             ^            ^   ^
```

While `std::swap` cannot be defined for two different types, and neither `vector` constructor takes `string` as an argument to steal its contents (cf. `move`), nor `string` constructor does that for `vector`, we have to look for another solution. This article is an attempt to use structural equivalence and custom allocators as an enabler of heterogeneous swap.

Side note. Revision C++14 of the language brings [`T std::exchange(T&, U&&)`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/exchange) that implements a heteregenous "replace with" algorithm. Unfortunately, there is a type constraint put on objects of type `T` that states there shall be possible to move-assign objects of type `U` to `T` objects, i.e. `T` shall define a move-assignment operator that takes a `U` object. In other words, definition of `T` type assumes both the existence and the properties of `U` type, and explicitly exposes mechanics to _cooperate_ with the internals of that type, which all does not fit our case.

## Equivalence

If we look a little bit closer at the swap behaviour we will realise that it works because there is an implicit _structural_ equivalence relation established between its operands. That is, `swap(T, U)` will do what's expected if `T` and `U` data types are equivalent. Type checker in the C++ language implements type equivalence in a form of name equivalence (strong (new types) &mdash; `class`, `enum class`, and loose (type aliases) &mdash; `typedef`, `enum`), consider the following:

```c++
// E and F are distinct under strong name equivalence
enum class E { foo };
enum class F { foo };

// int and X::bad are equivalent under loose name equivalence
enum X { bad };
int horribly = bad;
```

While name equivalence is desired for the compiler, `swap` implementation is interested in the actual structure of the type to be able to actually swap the things. Sadly, C++ language does not offer built-in constructs to perform a structural equivalence test on types, i.e. compare the types recursively, rather than the values they describe, which is a tough task in general. Consider the following:

```c++
// A and B are equivalent under structural equivalence
// A and B are distinct   under name       equivalence
class A { int i; };
class B { int i; };
```

Having that, `std::swap` constraints its both operands to be of a single (i.e. homogeneous) `T` type, that in turn, guarantees structural equivalence for free. On the other hand, heterogeneous `swap` requires an additional _predicate_ that judges whether two types are structurally equivalent, (simplified) C++20 snippet follows:

```c++
template<class T, class U> void swap(T&, U&) requires StructurallyEquivalent<T, U>;
```

Where `StructurallyEquivalent` concept is a predicate that ensures `T` and `U` are structurally equivalent:

```c++
template<class T, class U>
concept StructurallyEquivalent
  = Same<T, U>  // homogeneous, std::swap case
 || requires    // heterogeneous
    {
      // magic here
    };
```

Heterogeneous case requires aÂ dedicated construct to run the actual structural equivalence check on `T` and `U` types.

---

Side note. Structural equivalence is very useful in software source code analysis, aka "code reading"; as well as in the software prototyping. If we imagine that every piece of code has its functional equivalent expressed in a plain structural equivalent, and a set of actions with attributes (like `async`, `generated`, etc.); and if we limit the set of structural equivalents to an absolute minimum, e.g. to a _list_ construct as it was done in Lisp; or sequences `[a]`, tuples `(t, u, ...)`, alternatives `x|y|...`, and combined types like maps `[(k1, v1), (k2, v2), ...]`; we will be able to describe a piece of software in terms of that equivalents and functions that transform equivalents into other equivalents.

## Concepts

Let's tackle the problem from the concepts' perspective. Function template `std::swap`, which is parametrised by type `T`, imposes following requirements on its parameter:
* `MoveAssignable` and `MoveConstructible`; predicates: [`std::is_move_constructible_v`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_move_constructible) and [`std::is_move_assignable_v`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_move_assignable).
* `Swappable` for `[T]`; predicate: [`std::is_swappable_v`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/is_swappable).

Interestingly, `Swappable` can be realised by means of a `std` trait parametrised by two (possibly) distinct types, which may be used during definition of a `StructurallyEquivalent` concept:

```
template<class T, class U> struct is_swappable_with;
```

Looking further, `std::basic_string<char>` (aka `std::string`) meets the following requirements:
* [`AllocatorAwareContainer`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AllocatorAwareContainer); customisation point: [`std::allocator_traits<A>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/AllocatorAwareContainer).
* [`SequenceContainer`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer), and [`ContiguousContainer`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer) which is a conjunction of [`Container`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Container), [`LegacyRandomAccessIterator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/RandomAccessIterator), and [`LegacyContiguousIterator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousIterator) for iterator's nested member type.

Type constructor [`std::vector`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) (for `T` other than `bool`) meets the requirements of `AllocatorAwareContainer`, `SequenceContainer`, `ContiguousContainer`, `Container`, and [`ReversibleContainer`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ReversibleContainer); where `ReversibleContainer` must additionally satisify `LegacyRandomAccessIterator` (also required by `ContiguousContainer`) _or_ [`LegacyBidirectionalIterator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/BidirectionalIterator) (which is a subset of `LegacyRandomAccessIterator`).

It is easy to notice that `std::vector` meets all the requirements of `std::string` if it satisfies `LegacyRandomAccessIterator` (in `ReversibleContainer`). From the concept-based point of view, `std::vector<T>` is a subset of `std::string` for some `T`.

Side note. It is worth to note that while both the following concepts must be satisified for `std::vector`, the `ContiguousContainer` requires `LegacyRandomAccessIterator` solely, but `ReversibleContainer` is free to choose its weaker form (i.e. `LegacyBidirectionalIterator`).


## AllocatorAwareContainer and direct memory access

Once we establish a structural equivalence for a pair of types, we may try to _swap_ their memory representations. The actual handle to a memory region is known and it is managed by the object itself by means of an allocator object which we may prepare and inject into that object.

In order to do that we need to define a custom allocator, its properties that fulfill ["allocator completeness requirements"](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Allocator#Allocator_completeness_requirements) (via optional specialisation of [`std::allocator_traits`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator_traits)), and the actual behaviour during the swap operation. Caveat here: the allocator itself does not know the `swap` operation is ongoing, moreover there is no possiblity to update the internals of the swapped objects from inside the allocator object (but we may return a handle to the last allocated memory region as it was stored in the allocator state upon call to `allocate`).

We want to transfer the current state from one abstraction to the another, thus the designed allocator shall be stateful.

Notice that by performing a heterogeneous `swap` we, in fact, simulate `move` in contexts where it is actually not supported by design at all (like `vector<char> v = move(str)` where type of `str` is `string`).

Even if [`pmr`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/polymorphic_allocator) offers dynamic selection of an allocator, we cannot use it. Consider this note from the reference (emphasis is mine):
> `polymorphic_allocator` **does not propagate on** container copy assignment, move assignment, or **swap**. As a result, move assignment of a `polymorphic_allocator`-using container can throw, and swapping two `polymorphic_allocator`-using containers whose allocators do not compare equal results in undefined behavior. 

We want to move the state while swapping the data of type `T` allocated using `Alloc<T>`. To do so we need to inform `allocator_traits` through `propagate_on_container_swap` member type that it is acutally possible.

```c++
template<class T, class BackingT>
struct ByteSeqAlloc
{
  using allocator_type = ByteSeqAlloc;
  using propagate_on_container_swap = std::true_type;
  using value_type = T;
  
  static_assert(std::is_convertible_v<T, BackingT>
             && std::is_convertible_v<BackingT, T>);
  
  // state [--
  BackingT* last    = nullptr;  // last allocated ptr
  std::size_t lastN = 0;        // last passed n
  bool reuse        = false;    // shall next allocate reuse `last`?
  // --] state end

  [[nodiscard]] T* allocate(std::size_t n)
  {
    // ... 
    
    if (auto p = static_cast<T*>(reuse ? last : std::malloc(n * sizeof(U))))
    {
      last = reinterpret_cast<BackingT*>(p);

      return reuse
              ? (reuse = false, reinterpret_cast<T*>(last))
              : (lastN = n, p);
    }
  }
  
  // ...
};

std::pair<U, T> swap(T& t, U& t)
{
  auto aT = t.get_allocator();
  auto aU = u.get_allocator();
  
  aT.reuse = true;
  aU.reuse = true;

  // inspect lastN and last to construct
  // copies of T and U with swapped data
  // (allocate shall return prepared memory)
}
```
```
using BackingT = std::common_type_t<char, std::int8_t>;

std::basic_string<
    char
  , std::char_traits<char>
  , ByteSeqAlloc<char, BackingT>
  > s = {'a', 'b', ...};

std::vector<
    std::int8_t
  , ByteSeqAlloc<std::int8_t, BackingT>
  > v = {97, 98, ...};
  
auto [v1, s1] = swap(s, v);
```

Propagation of an allocator is applicable to the standard homogeneous swap only!

Unfortunately, that's a the dead end rather than a working solution. Memory management issues come into play, e.g. what if the original items that hold the pointers to the allocated memory try to reclaim it. SBO optimisation in `std::string` completely bypasses the allocator, i.e. this solution may work only for large enough strings. Moreover, depending on the [initialisation scheme](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/initialization) chosen we may get the intercepted memory region zeroed.

## Alternative

To solve our puzzle we will redefine the problem. Rather than looking for a converter of `T` into `U`, we will search for an  interpreter of a memory region, so that it can be represented either as `T` or `U`. That is, having a fixed allocated memory region we will apply _views_ that expose bytes within that region to the user through _defined_ abstractions (non-owning). 

C++ offers [`std::span`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/span) and [`std::string_view`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string_view) as a non-owning containers, while [`ranges::to` (P1206R1)](wg21.link/p1206) functionality offers conversion of a range to a container (by means of a structural equivalence). In fact, none of the presented abstractions matches all of our needs. Consider the following `view_as` memory region interpreter:

```c++
template<class T, std::size_t Step = 1>
struct view_as
{
  view_as() = default;
  
  template<class U>
  view_as(U* p, std::size_t t)
    :
      data{reinterpret_cast<char*>(const_cast<std::remove_const_t<U>*>(p))}
    , total{t}
    , current{0}
  {}
  
  T& operator()()             { return *next(*this); }
  const T& operator()() const { return *next(*this); }

 private:
 
  template<class U, std::size_t S>
  static auto next(view_as<U, S>& v)
    -> std::conditional_t<
           std::is_const_v<decltype(v)>
         , const U*
         , U*
         >
  {
    if (v.data && (v.current < v.total))
    { 
      U* u = reinterpret_cast<U*>(v.data + (v.current * sizeof(U)));
      v.current += S * sizeof(U);
      
      return u;
    }
    else { throw std::out_of_range{""}; };
  }
 
  char*       data    = nullptr;
  std::size_t total   = 0;
  std::size_t current = 0;
};

// usage:
// subsequent calls to v() give: 25185, 105, 11363
std::string s = "abcdefghi";
view_as<std::int16_t, 2> v{s.data(), s.length()};
```

By means of `view_as` we can re-interpret the data, and skip selected values in the passed memory region. Currently, we are suffering from absence of standard iterator interface, but it is an open point for further improvements.

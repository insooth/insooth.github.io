          This article presents a solution that enables injection of a custom code to
          be executed once all the non-static members are initialised. Presented technique
          is particulary useful in case of constructor inheritance and use of "member initializer" feature.

        <p class="abstract">
         Among all the various design patterns widely used by the C++ language community,
         probably only the visitor pattern takes advantage of the language type system
          in such a sophisticated way. Visitor pattern provides a solution to a recurring
          problem found in object-oriented designs (and in any other that use runtime-supported
          subtype polymorphism), namely the determination of the actual type of the object
          referenced by some interface type. This article will revisit the core idea behind
          that design pattern, mention couple of existing implementations, and describe
          a C++14 implementation of the visitor that aims to be flexible and type-safe
          as much as the template-based solution is, but remains in the domain of fixed
          (non-template) types favoured by the classic interfaces based on the virtual
          member functions.

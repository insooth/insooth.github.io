        <p class="abstract">
          How would you look for an item in a tuple by the item's type, and return the item's index within that tuple?
          This article presents the answer to that question which is composed of an application of lazy fold expression,
          and an idea of type embellishment that lets us introduce an implicit context in which the current element is embedded.

        <p class="abstract">
          I was asked recently a question about the template instance's parameters inspection
          possibilities in order to be able to stringify the types and integral constants used
          to create that instance. Namely, having a template with N parameters, and an instance
          (an object or just a type) of that template we would like to print the text representation
          of the parameters with which that instance was created. This article presents an example
          solution to that problem.

        <p class="abstract">
          State is inevitable. Essential in practice, a side-effect, is a change applied to a shared global state.
          With the state up front, we make it easily trackable and visible in the data-flow diagrams. 
          No more bad surprises after refactoring, at least in theory.

          It is almost unbelievable how it is easy to commit a sin against simplicity.
          Consider a funcionality that converts some data type into an another one data type.
          All the information required to do a conversion is included in the original data type.

        <p class="abstract">
          Definition of actions is not a trivial task. The resulting abstraction that embeds
          the defined actions does not have to be a set of virtual member functions wrapped
          into a class from which implementations exposed to the user derive. General guideline
          promoted in this article is to expose non-virtual interfaces to the user while providing
          a customisation point in the form of a minimal set of actions that can be combined
          with each other.

          This article presents a solution that enables injection of a custom code to
          be executed once all the non-static members are initialised. Presented technique
          is particulary useful in case of constructor inheritance and use of "member initializer" feature.

        <p class="abstract">
         Among all the various design patterns widely used by the C++ language community,
         probably only the visitor pattern takes advantage of the language type system
          in such a sophisticated way. Visitor pattern provides a solution to a recurring
          problem found in object-oriented designs (and in any other that use runtime-supported
          subtype polymorphism), namely the determination of the actual type of the object
          referenced by some interface type. This article will revisit the core idea behind
          that design pattern, mention couple of existing implementations, and describe
          a C++14 implementation of the visitor that aims to be flexible and type-safe
          as much as the template-based solution is, but remains in the domain of fixed
          (non-template) types favoured by the classic interfaces based on the virtual
          member functions.
